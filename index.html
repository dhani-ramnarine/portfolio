							<h3><br>About Me</h3>
						</header>

						<P>Growing up on a small island in the Caribbean, the idea of pursuing higher education in the United States seemed like a distant dream. Yet, fueled by determination and a hunger for knowledge, I embarked on a journey that would shape the course of my career.
						</P>
									
						<p>After completing my high school education, I set my sights on attending the University of Miami to pursue my bachelor's degree. It was a daunting transition, leaving behind the familiar sights and sounds of home for the bustling streets of Miami. However, the opportunity for growth and exploration beckoned, and I eagerly embraced the challenges that lay ahead.</p>
												
						<p>During my time at the University of Miami, I immersed myself in my studies, eager to absorb as much knowledge as possible. It was here that I first discovered my passion for auditing, drawn to the intricate complexities of financial systems and the meticulous attention to detail required in the field.</p>
												
						<p>Upon graduating with my bachelor's degree, I secured an internship at one of the prestigious "Big Four" accounting firms—a pivotal moment that solidified my desire to pursue a career in auditing. As I delved into the world of financial statement auditing, I found myself captivated by the intricacies of the process, the thrill of uncovering discrepancies, and the satisfaction of ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.</p>
												
						<p>Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to excel, I wasted no time in furthering my education. In a whirlwind three weeks, I studied rigorously and passed the GMAT with flying colors, earning a full scholarship to pursue my master's degree at Barry University.</p>
												
						<p>My time at Barry University was nothing short of transformative. Armed with a newfound understanding of auditing principles and armed with a 4.0 GPA, I emerged ready to tackle the challenges that lay ahead. My career as a Financial Statement Auditor was off to a promising start, but I soon found myself drawn to the dynamic world of IT auditing.</p>
											
						<p>With a seamless transition, I embarked on a new chapter in my career, leveraging my expertise in industry-standard frameworks such as COBIT, NIST, ITIL, and COSO to navigate the intricate landscape of technology infrastructure and application security. Over the years, I honed my skills, overseeing engagements for prominent financial institutions regulated by the SEC, OCC, and FRB.</p>
											
						<p>My journey in IT auditing has been defined by a relentless pursuit of excellence. From conducting cybersecurity assessments to streamlining audit processes and enhancing risk responsiveness, I've dedicated myself to driving tangible results and mitigating technology risks.</p>
												
						<p>But beyond the technicalities of the job, it's the people and relationships that have truly enriched my experience. I've had the privilege of leading teams, cultivating impactful relationships with senior management, and spearheading initiatives aimed at fortifying data security and integrity.</p>
											
						<p>As I reflect on my journey thus far, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities that have shaped my career. From humble beginnings on a small island to the forefront of the auditing world, it's been a remarkable journey—one that has fueled my passion for excellence and inspired me to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field of IT auditing.</p>
